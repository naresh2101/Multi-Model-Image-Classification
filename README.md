# Multi-Model-Image-Classification
This project is related to CIFAR100 and CIFAR10 Image Classification with different kind of small model. Achieved accuracy more than 61% with very few parameters and epochs (200). Same model can be used for CIFAR10. With CIFAR10, more than 90% accuracy can be achieved.

User can learn how to generate small own inception and resnet model. Also, user can learn how to combine multiple models and multiple inputs to create unique model.
